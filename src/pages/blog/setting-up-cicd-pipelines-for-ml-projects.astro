  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to this introductory blog post about CI/CD pipelines for machine learning projects. 
    This is a placeholder version that will be expanded with more detailed content in the future.
  </p>

  <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
  <p>
    CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. These practices help teams 
    deliver software changes more efficiently and reliably.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Faster development cycles</li>
    <li>Improved code quality</li>
    <li>Automated testing</li>
    <li>Reliable deployments</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    To get started with CI/CD for machine learning projects, you'll need to understand the basics 
    of version control, automated testing, and deployment strategies.
  </p>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    In future articles, we'll explore detailed implementations of CI/CD pipelines for machine 
    learning projects, including code examples and best practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Stay tuned for more detailed content about implementing CI/CD pipelines for machine learning 
    projects. We'll cover everything from basic setup to advanced deployment strategies.
