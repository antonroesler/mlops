## Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Markdown. Writing content is much easier now!

## Adding Content

You can include:

- Regular paragraphs
- Lists like this one
- Code blocks
- Images

## Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Conclusion

That's it! Writing in Markdown is much simpler than HTML.
